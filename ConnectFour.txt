This is a program that allows the user to play the Connect Four game. 
It's consisted of 11 functions, which include: 

* Main Function which calls the DisplayMenu Funtion in order to start 
a game and to prompt the user about how to start a new game or quit 
after they have already finished one;

* DisplayMenu Function, which gives the user the information and instruct 
them on how to choose game mode and color mode, according to the user's 
input it will either call the RegularGame function or the AnvilGame function
with specified color mode option;

* PrintBoard function, which will print the board where the two players can 
place their checkers, the board will be updated with checkers after inputs 
are read in either RegularGame function or AnvilGame function. 

* RegularGame function, which allows the user to play a regular Connect Four 
game. Two players will take turns to place their checkers on the board. They
can do that by enter the correspond column numbers. Then the information will
be passed to the CheckColumn function to see if the column is available for
users. If not, the function will prompt the users to enter another roll number. 
After 7 checkers are placed on the board, this function will start calling the
four functions which check if any player has satisfied the win condition. If 
one of the three win condition is satisfied, the game ends and a message will be
shown on the screen to tell who wins the game. If the board is filled up before
anyone meet the win condition, the game also ends and player two wins. 

* AnvilGame function, which is mostly the same as the RegularGame function, except
that each user can have one anvil which allows them to clear the whole column of 
checkers and put the anvil at the bottom of the column. 

* CheckVertical/CheckHorizontal/CheckDiagonal function: these are the
functions that checks if one of the user can connect four of his checkers in
vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line. 

* CheckFull function: which is used to check if the board is filled up. If the 
board is full before any one meets the win condition, player 2 wins.
